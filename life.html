					<h2>Life of Taylor Swift</h2>
					<p>
						Taylor Swift, in full Taylor Alison Swift, (born
						December 13, 1989, West Reading, Pennsylvania, U.S.),
						American pop and country music singer-songwriter whose
						tales of young heartache achieved widespread success in
						the early 21st century.
						<br /><br />

						<strong>Early life</strong><br />
						Swift showed an interest in music at an early age, and
						she progressed quickly from roles in children's theatre
						to her first appearance before a crowd of thousands. She
						was age 11 when she sang “The Star-Spangled Banner”
						before a Philadelphia 76ers basketball game, and the
						following year she picked up the guitar and began to
						write songs. Taking her inspiration from country music
						artists such as Shania Twain and the Dixie Chicks, Swift
						crafted original material that reflected her experiences
						of tween alienation. When she was 13, Swift's parents
						sold their farm in Pennsylvania to move to
						Hendersonville, Tennessee, so that she could devote more
						of her time to courting country labels in nearby
						Nashville.
						<br /><br />

						A development deal with RCA Records allowed Swift to
						make the acquaintance of recording-industry veterans,
						and in 2004, at age 14, she signed with Sony/ATV as a
						songwriter. At venues in the Nashville area, she
						performed many of the songs she had written, and it was
						at one such performance that she was noticed by record
						executive Scott Borchetta. Borchetta signed Swift to his
						fledgling Big Machine label, and her first single, “Tim
						McGraw” (inspired by and prominently referencing a song
						by Swift's favourite country artist), was released in
						the summer of 2006.
						<br /><br />

						<strong>Debut album and Fearless</strong><br />
						The song was an immediate success, spending eight months
						on the Billboard country singles chart. Now age 16,
						Swift followed with a self-titled debut album, and she
						went on tour, opening for Rascal Flatts. Taylor Swift
						was certified platinum in 2007, having sold more than
						one million copies in the United States, and Swift
						continued a rigorous touring schedule, opening for
						artists such as George Strait, Kenny Chesney, Tim
						McGraw, and Faith Hill. That November Swift received the
						Horizon Award for best new artist from the Country Music
						Association (CMA), capping the year in which she emerged
						as country music's most-visible young star.
						<br /><br />

						On Swift's second album, Fearless (2008), she
						demonstrated a refined pop sensibility, managing to
						court the mainstream pop audience without losing sight
						of her country roots. With sales of more than half a
						million copies in its first week, Fearless opened at
						number one on the Billboard 200 chart. It ultimately
						spent more time atop that chart than any other album
						released that decade. Singles such as “You Belong with
						Me” and “Love Story” were popular in the digital market
						as well, the latter accounting for more than four
						million paid downloads.
						<br /><br />

						<strong
							>Kanye West incident at the VMAs, Red, and
							1989</strong
						><br />
						In 2009 Swift embarked on her first tour as a headliner,
						playing to sold-out venues across North America. That
						year also saw Swift dominate the industry award circuit.
						Fearless was recognized as album of the year by the
						Academy of Country Music in April, and she topped the
						best female video category for “You Belong with Me” at
						the MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs) in September. During
						her VMA acceptance speech, Swift was interrupted by
						rapper Kanye West, who protested that the award should
						have gone to Beyoncé for what he called “one of the best
						videos of all time.” Later in the program, when Beyoncé
						was accepting the award for video of the year, she
						invited Swift onstage to conclude her speech, a move
						that drew a standing ovation for both performers. At the
						CMA Awards that November, Swift won all four categories
						in which she was nominated. Her recognition as CMA
						entertainer of the year made her the youngest-ever
						winner of that award, as well as the first female solo
						artist to win since 1999. She began 2010 with an
						impressive showing at the Grammy Awards, where she
						collected four honours, including best country song,
						best country album, and the top prize of album of the
						year.
						<br /><br />

						Later that year Swift made her feature-film debut in the
						romantic comedy Valentine's Day and was named the new
						spokesperson for CoverGirl cosmetics. Although Swift
						avoided discussing her personal life in interviews, she
						was surprisingly frank in her music. Her third album,
						Speak Now (2010), was littered with allusions to
						romantic relationships with John Mayer, Joe Jonas of the
						Jonas Brothers, and Twilight series actor Taylor
						Lautner. Swift reclaimed the CMA entertainer of the year
						award in 2011, and the following year she won Grammys
						for best country solo performance and best country song
						for “Mean,” a single from Speak Now.
						<br /><br />

						Swift continued her acting career with a voice role in
						the animated Dr. Seuss' The Lorax (2012) before
						releasing her next collection of songs, Red (2012).
						While she remained focused on the vagaries of young
						love, her songwriting reflected a deepened perspective
						on the subject, and much of the album embraced a bold
						pop-rock sound. In its first week on sale in the United
						States, Red sold 1.2 million copies—the highest one-week
						total in 10 years. In addition, its lead single, the
						gleeful “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,” gave
						Swift her first number-one hit on the Billboard pop
						singles chart.
						<br /><br />

						In 2014 Swift released 1989, an album titled after the
						year of her birth and reportedly inspired by the music
						of that era. Although Swift had already been steadily
						moving away from the traditional country signifiers that
						marked her early work—“I Knew You Were Trouble,” the
						second single from Red, even flirted with electronic
						dance music—she called 1989 her first “official pop
						album.” On the strength of the upbeat “Shake It Off,”
						the album proved to be another blockbuster for Swift,
						with its first-week sales surpassing those of Red. It
						went on to sell more than five million copies in the
						United States and earned Swift her second Grammy for
						album of the year. In 2014 Swift also appeared in a
						supporting role in The Giver, a film adaptation of Lois
						Lowry's dystopian novel for young readers.
						<br /><br />

						<strong>Later albums and controversies</strong><br />
						In 2016 Swift's feud with Kanye West resumed after he
						released the single “Famous.” The song included a lyric
						in which Swift was referred to as a “bitch,” and she
						alleged that it was misogynistic. The public spat
						escalated after West's wife, Kim Kardashian, released a
						recording of a phone call in which Swift gave her
						approval for the line, though West made no mention of
						calling her a bitch. Swift's controversies continued as
						she took part in a widely publicized civil trial in
						August 2017, after former radio host David Mueller sued
						the singer, her mother, and a promoter, claiming that
						Swift had falsely accused him of sexually groping her in
						2013 during the taking of a photograph and thus
						destroyed his career. She countersued, maintaining that
						the assault had taken place. At the trial, Swift was
						removed from Mueller's suit and the other two defendants
						were found not liable as the jury found in favour of
						Swift's countersuit. Shortly thereafter Swift released
						the hit song “Look What You Made Me Do,” and her album
						Reputation became the top-selling American LP of 2017.
						<br /><br />

						In 2018 Swift left Big Machine and signed with Republic
						Records and Universal Music Group. The following year
						her former label, which owned the master recordings of
						her six albums, was sold to Scooter Braun, a talent
						manager whose clients had included Kanye West. Swift
						publicly spoke out against the deal, claiming that
						Borchetta had rejected her attempts to acquire the
						master tapes and that Braun had bullied her over the
						years. She subsequently tried to negotiate a deal with
						Braun, but he sold her back catalog to a private
						investment firm in 2020. Against this backdrop, Swift
						began rerecording her early material in an effort to
						gain control of it—the hope being that her remade songs
						and not the originals would be sought out for licensing
						deals—and in 2021 Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red
						(Taylor's Version) appeared. They were remakes of
						earlier albums with several previously unreleased
						tracks.
						<br /><br />

						In 2019 Swift released her seventh album, Lover, which
						she described as “a love letter to love itself.” That
						year she also appeared in the musical Cats, a film
						adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's hugely successful
						stage production. Miss Americana (2020) is a documentary
						about her life and career. With little advance notice,
						she released folklore in 2020. A departure from her
						previous pop-inspired work, Swift's eighth studio album
						drew praise for its introspection and restraint, and it
						won the Grammy for album of the year. The “sister
						record,” ,Evermore appeared later in 2020. Swift adopted
						a synth-pop sound for the candid Midnights (2022), which
						she described as “the story of 13 sleepless nights
						scattered throughout my life.”
